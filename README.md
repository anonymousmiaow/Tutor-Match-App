# Design

## Color Palette

Our color palette is inspired by the blackboard, which is a dark green color. The profile page designs has lighter green hue for background. We also have orange and blue tones throughout the website, which are reflected in colors of some buttons and text.

## Changes made to improve accessibility and usability

1. The color contrast for the navbar was increased to ratio of 4.5:1. Originally the tabs that were not active would appear darker, however that did not pass the accessibility validator.

2. Contrast of landing page changed to have the background in a darker gradient to allow the text to pop more
   original:

3. The buttons on the main page will appear bigger in size when hovered to let users know they these are focused/hovered, in case color changes are not obvious.
